{1 Geospatial Primitives and Algorithms}

The {! Geo} library provides convenient algorithms and primitives for working
with geospatial data. It uses the scientific-computing library {{: https://ocaml.xyz/} Owl}
with an identical runtime representation for all the primitives: [Owl_base_dense_ndarray_d.arr].

Every primitive can be converted to [Owl_base_dense_ndarray_d.arr] and will look as you might expect.
For example a {! Geo.Coord.t} will be an array with one row and two or three colums (depending on the coordinate system).
